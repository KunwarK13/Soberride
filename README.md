## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code for **SoberRide**.

It has the code for the application, AI model, and device itself. 

The application was coded using the React Native framework, the AI model in Python, and the device in C++ (since it was an Arduino).

We have created a device that detects drivers' breath alcohol content (BrAC) and can prevent them from operating the vehicle if intoxicated.
